# Context Menu Option to Run Filters
This add-on adds a context menu item when you right/context-click a folder or a message that allows you to run rules on them.

## Credits
- Other add-ons like [Filter on Folder Button](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/filter-on-folder-button/) and [New Folder Filters Button](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/new-folder-filters-button/) do similar work. The difference is that this add-on adds the options to the context menu.
- The icon is made by [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/).
